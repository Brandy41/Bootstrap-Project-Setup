                    Hi my name is Steve Newell, a Professional Inspector licensed by the <a href="https://cib.ok.gov/"> Oklahoma Construction Industries Board</a> License
                    # 70002265.  I have a Master of Construction Management degree from North Dakota State University, over two decades
                    of inspection and construction experience. At this point in your home search why would you consider hiring anyone 
                    less qualified?
                    <br>
                    Whichever side of the for sale sign you’re on, choosing the most qualified Professional Home Inspector is an important
                    and critical choice for you to make. Here at Newell’s Home Inspection I understand that buying a home can be one of the
                    most important financial investments you will ever make, and also among the greatest sources of anxiety.
                </p>
            <h6 class="secondh">Why Newell Home Inspection should be your #1 Choice for Enid Home Inspections!</h6>    
                <p>I am dedicated to relieving your anxiety by providing you with the knowledge and peace of mind necessary to make an informed d
                    ecision about your potential new home.</p>
            <h6 class="thirdh">How do I accomplish this?</h6> 
                <p class="secondp">
                    By utilizing my education, construction, quality control and extensive home inspector experience and training for your 
                    benefit. I provide my clients with a professional report which is clear, concise, and easy to follow, the report includes
                    relevant digital photographs. Your inspection report will be delivered via email within 24 hours of your inspection.
                    <br>
                    The inspection itself is a systematic examination of the condition of the property, from foundation to roof to uncover 
                    hidden defects; this thorough examination serves to protect your investment and sanity. Every home will have defects, even 
                    a newly constructed home. My report will tell you about those defects.
                </p>
            <h6 class="fourthh"></h6>
            <h6 class="fifthH"></h6>
                <p>
                    I know that your schedule is very hectic, so I work hard to accommodate you. I perform two inspections per day, the first 
                    inspection starts at around 8 am, and the second inspection starts at around 1pm. This schedule provides me with amble time
                    to perform a thorough inspection and provides me with enough time to get to my next inspection. Not everyone can attend a 
                    weekday inspection, so I do perform inspections at the weekend; however these slots fill up fast. I will do my best to 
                    accommodate you.
                </p>
